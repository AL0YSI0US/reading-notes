# Project Ideas

What ideas do you have for projects? What would your model be that you can control and update the view with? What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?

Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) for inspiration about APIs you could use.

For those of you who were in 201, be sure to look back at the project discussion assignment from that course and see if there is anything from there that was not done that could be carried forward as an idea for this class.
